I started work on a prototype game called, 'Fat Kitteh' a while back. You play a heavyset kitten whose job it is to destroy houses. The game wasn't terribly fun. The components however provided the groundwork for another game. I started work about two weeks ago on one called, "Metal Sky: Arena." Name subject to change. You play in a zero-G arena where the walls will kill you. Your armament is only a gravity gun, which you will use to hurl your opponents into the walls. I uploaded a very early build to the site.
