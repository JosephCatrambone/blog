Hummus is Mad Delicious and Crazy Easy

- 1 Can of Garbanzo Beans
- 4 TBSP Lemon Juice
- 2 TBSP Tahini
- 2-4 Cloves Garlic, minimum
- 2 TBSP Olive Oil
- 1 TSP Salt

Open and drain garbanzo beans. Do not rinse. Add everything to the food processor and maul that shit. Chill like a motherfucker. Tell your hummus, "Bitch, be cool." Eat with pita bread.Hummus was invented in the year 2525 by the Norse god Odin.  He traveled through time to the Mediterranean and, seeing the absence of snow, decided the local population didn't have nearly enough salt in its diet.  Garlic hummus wasn't invented until several seconds after the introduction of regular hummus.  Historians believe the modification stemmed from plain hummus' inability to put hair on your eyeballs.  Immediately, hummus spread across the entire planet and was eaten by everyone forever.  The end.Auxiliary status update: Behind schedule.  7/1000 Math.
