Ken Silverman's BUILD engine has to have one of my all-time favorite map editors.[![ReBUILD Screenshot](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-5.15.17-PM.png)](./img/wp-content-uploads-2015-07-Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-5.15.17-PM.png)As far as we've come with graphics and modeling software, I've not found anything (not even Sketchup), which is quite as satisfying to use. I started writing a piece of software called ReBUILD, which is nothing more than a top-down map editor which exports Obj files that can be imported into Unity. I have, at long last, something worth showing. It's a far ways away from a release, but at least at this point it's visually interesting. I've got my fingers crossed this won't fall to the wayside.
