While making this animation for Hidden Asbestos, the flare effect from the gun kept getting drawn with edges by the Freestyle rendering engine in Blender. It wasn't too crazy to find a solution online, but it wasn't immediately clear, either. The top result was actually for partially excluding lines. I needed to exclude the entire object. I did this by selecting the muzzle flash and adding it to a group, then selecting Freestyle > Selection By > Group > Exclude, and adding my flash to a group. The result:[![Swat Fire 2](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/swat_fire_2.gif)](./img/wp-content-uploads-2014-07-swat_fire_2.gif)
