Still working on Terminus.  Did some MAJOR refactoring today and somehow managed to make the code messier in the process.  Easier to add new features, however.  It'll probably be easier to come back and understand it, too.  What's left to add?

- Saverooms
- Respawn/Reload
- Story
- Graphics
- Weapon/Player Upgrades

And a screenshot for Screenshot Saturday:
