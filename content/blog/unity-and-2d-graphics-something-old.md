I've used a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and engines in my time as a software developer. Although I always wanted an excuse to use Unity, I had issues with each of the different options for rendering to the screen. Recently, someone posted on Reddit about a new/old framework for Unity. It's called Futile, and it's a code-based approach to 2D game work in Unity. I think I'm in love. Futile is a throw back to the style of game development with which I am most familiar. I get all the nice extra tidbits that Unity offers, like deployment to Android and iOS, hardware acceleration, sound support, and so forth, without the frustration that has accompanied every other library so far. libgdx, as much as I want to like it, does some things which drive me up the wall. I spent a surprisingly non-trivial amount of time just getting stuff to display to the scene. Three days it took to simply get the animation and vehicle spawning from the Methracer prototype into the libgdx framework. In a single day with Unity and Futile, I'm nearing completion of the port. It's worth checking out: <http://struct.ca/futile/>
