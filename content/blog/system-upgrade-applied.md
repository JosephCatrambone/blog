Updated nVidia drivers. What's the worst that could happen?nVidia CUDA updated. TensorFlow is broken. Try installing TensorFlow nightly. Incompatible. Try to build TensorFlow from source. Need to install Bazel. Add repository for Bazel. Conflict with version of JVM I have on my machine. I have Oracle's JDK 8. Requires JDK 8+. (What?) Download binary for Bazel. Fails because it actually has a hard check for a JDK9+ version. ("Problem with java installation: couldn't find/access rt.jar in /usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64")
