I bought a sandwich from a homeless dude today.Not for. From.I was walking to the train stop and this dude asks if I have any change. I gave him what I had and he thrust a footlong subway sandwich into my hands. I looked at it, not entirely sure how to react. "I don't eat pork." Squeamish as I am, I accepted. Sucks to waste food, and meat in particular.As I walked away, the events reconfigured themselves in my head. The only reason I \_had\_ the change was because I told the other homeless guy at the train stop I'd buy him a granola bar on the way back since I didn't have any change. When I got there, though, he was gone. So now I've got a sandwich \_and\_ a granola bar \_and\_ probably a dude who is really mad about how long it took for to get food.The sandwich is sitting in my fridge. Not sure if I should eat it.
