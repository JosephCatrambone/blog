Oh god how did this get here I am not good with computer.My name's Jo.  A few years ago I decided that I wasn't happy with the person I was.  Things are getting better every day, but there's a long way to go.  This web log is a public collection of my goals and ideals with terrible jokes interspersed.  From 2012/01/01 to 2012/12/30, I'm going to finish 1000 math problems of various forms and difficulties, draw 100 pictures, and complete 6 games.  This will catalog the endeavor.
