Despite my numerous objections to and stated loathing of emotional impetus, I recognize that triggering an emotional response can be an effective means to initiate action.  Holding true that idea, I provide the following statement of purpose.I will be excellent to those who are excellent to me.  I will be decent to everyone, even those who are not decent in return.  I will try to understand the qualms of those who oppose me, and will work to resolve conflicts with diplomacy rather than force of will.I will work hard to achieve the goals I set for myself and the goals others have set for me.  I will not treat myself as the sole author of my victories, nor will I be the victim of my defeats.  My shortcomings are my fault alone and my successes belong to those who supported me.I will be thankful of the compromises other people make for me.  I will not overvalue the compromises I make for others.I will not whine over things that cannot be changed, but will be critical of those things that can.  I will critique in a way that is beneficial to the reader and will take every measure to avoid being purposelessly angry.I will not let my failures haunt me, but will treat them as solemn referendums of the things I failed to accomplish.  I will heed them as advice on how not to proceed in the future.I will finish what I start, and recognize when the journey is a means to an end, or an adventure in itself.These rules are for me alone, and I expect none but myself to abide by them.
