Recently, [this Imgurian](https://imgur.com/gallery/cH3YG) posted about cashing in a large container full of change. From the image, it looks like the container could hold about 16.9L of water. Let's see if we can calculate the approximate value of the change within, then, using the final total, calculate the difference between an optimal 'liquid' currency and the actual stored coins.US Mint Specifications are linked here: [http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specific ations](<http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specific
ations>)We know (by sources which I can't find), that a pound of change \[453.6g] is worth $20.Quarters have a density of 8.9 g/ml (10.5 g/ml for older ones). Dimes have density of 2.268g/(1.35mm \* (pi \* (17.91 mm/2)^2)), or 6.669 g/ml. Nickels have a density of 5g / (1.95mm \* (pi \* (21.21 mm / 2)^2)), or 2.257 g/ml.Let's forget we know that fact for a moment and instead calculate the best-case packing scenarios.1 quarter uses 8.089 x 10-4 L. 1 dime uses 3.401 x 10^-4 L. 1 nickel uses 6.89 x 10^-4 L.
