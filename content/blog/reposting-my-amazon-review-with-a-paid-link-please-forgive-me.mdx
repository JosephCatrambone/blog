SMBC is a long standing favorite for me. I jumped at the opportunity to purchase "Save Yourself, Mammal!" when I heard it was headed to print. The humor is consistently outstanding, and there were several comics which had me in tears. My biggest lamentation is that the collection is a bit sparse for my tastes. Having come from the full 2000+ collection of online comics, I was disappointed to discover so few were included in this publication. That said, I believe it's a better assortment than that present in the second book: The Most Dangerous Game. Hopefully we will see someday the full SMBC anthology, which I believe should be named, "The Gigantic Weiner Book." Perhaps someday a person will come along and scrape the SMBC site and compile the entire collection into something readable on the kindle. Until then, I recommend picking up his books:[Save Yourself, Mammal!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098285370X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=098285370X&linkCode=as2&tag=josbl0bf-20) [The Most Dangerous Game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982853718/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982853718&linkCode=as2&tag=josbl0bf-20)
