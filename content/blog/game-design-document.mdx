I realized that although I've been talking a lot about Pissim these past few updates, I never made it clear exactly what I was building. Allow me to dump the design document:"Hey ladies! Have you ever wanted to pee so standing up?" "Hey fellas! Have you ever wanted to be longer (from the toilet)?" "PISSING SIMULATOR 2013"Mechanics: WASD for slow walking in the same direction. Mouse to aim. Press space to fart.Goal: Need to get a certain amount in the receptacle.Stage Scenarios: Startup and tutorial. Wasted. (On ground. Can't move. Physics off.) Airplane Turbulence. (To the Saber Dance.) Bear Fight. (Piss down bear attacks while driving away.) Server Fires. (Pissing out fires in a server room.) Mega-Urinal. (Urinals attached to column which rotates. Urinals go up and down.)Achievements: Flippant Asshole (100% on seat)" Trans-urinal (Pee in three or more urinals in the same scenario, walking slowly between them) Self-Cleaning (Pee on oneself) Longshot (Hit urinal at over 10feet) Sinking Feeling (Pee in sink) The Intimidator (Outfart someone taking a dump in the stall)Easter Eggs: R. Kelly song playing in room. Being able to pee over stall wall onto someone. Pressing space to fart too much will result in crapping yourself.Lady Version: Lunar Lander, but with leg strength instead of fuel.
