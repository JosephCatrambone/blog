It's happening!![](./img/wp-content-uploads-summer_jam.png)This year's theme: Sequels!After spitballing in Discord for a while, I decided to make a sequel/spinoff to Enter the Matrix. The Matrix really needed sequels, right?Gameplay: A side-scrolling 2D platformer/beat 'em up.Minimum Viable Product:

1. 2D character controls with jumping and collision (weekend 1)
2. Punching and kicking with some visual indicator (weekend 1)
3. Enemies that respond to punches (weekend 1)
4. A start and end state with menus, spawning, death, and completion (weekend 2)
5. An environment the player can traverse from start to end (weekend 2)

Stretch goals:

1. JUICE for enemy impacts.
2. Animated player moves.
3. A combo system.
4. Backstory and dialog systems.

Let's roll.
