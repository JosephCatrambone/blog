The game is playable.  Nicklas is searching for mayo but can find none.  Tear apart the house until it is found.  The game is playable but not fun.  A lot of corners were cut to make it ready for today.  Graphically, it sucks (because I am a terrible artist), but perhaps as the system becomes more mature I'll feel the compulsion to add real art and effort.
