I got a text last weekend with the ever-insidious, "You have a car, right?"  I, content with the state of the world, decided to responded with, "I have.  Need a ride?"  This led into negotiations wherein I would give a few distant friends a ride to wizard world in exchange for paid parking, or something to that effect.  I was more concerned at the time about the imminent prospect of being fired (which I was not) and with finding a new job in case I was fired (which I did -- more on that later).  I hadn't any other plans at the time, so I offered a ride there and back, thinking I would do a simple drop-off pick up and be the hero/guy with a car for the day.  Here is what actually happened.Ride to their place.  Fucking Google Maps.  I don't need to take the freeway to a-- oh here it is.The trip to the convention center."Oh.  This is a comic book convention.""Okay yeah.  I'll help you guys set up.  Press pass?  Cool.""Do you guys want me to do something useful?  I hate being idle.  Yeah, I'll hand out flyers.""Yeah, I can sit on the pan-- wait what?"Okay panel.Falling off the stage at the end.Losing the car because the garage was rearranged around us.  (Set of doors locked because they were broken.)
