Conjecture: authentic far-right discourse is indistinguishable from parody. I'd like to call this, "Onion's Law," after the newspaper.Take the following examples. Some of them are real. Some of them are not. See if you can guess. No cheating."The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous."

<!-- REAL!  Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) appeared on Voice of Christian Youth Americaâ€™s radio program Crosstalk -->

"Speak English. If it was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for America."

<!-- FAKE! Though was presented as coming from Rick Santorum's twitter feed by Bill Mahr.-->

"I thought was a free enterpriser. He was a carpenter's son and I thought he was doing well. He was able to change water into wine; now that to me is the classic definition of a guy in the entrepreneurial spirit."

<!-- REAL!  Gov. Tommy Thompson, R-Wis., responding to a reporter who asked him if Jesus was a socialist, Madison (Wis.) Capital Times, 7/10/96 -->

"They're not poor because of how-- because of the way they are. They're poor because they're lazy."

<!-- Fake! -->

"Why is Earth Day, today, also Lenin's birthday? Coincidence? Or does it signal the true intent of the national and worldwide environmental movement?"

<!-- REAL!  Alan Caruba, Fargo Forum, 4/22/97 -->
