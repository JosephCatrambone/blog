SomethingAwful is doing a bi-weekly game challenge. This week's theme is taking a song and turning it into a game. My game for this competition and the end of April deadline is finished. It's called, "Politically Correct", off the SR-71 album, "Now You See Inside."I've never used Javascript to make a game before. It's different. Not entirely pleasant, but not as bad as I figured it would be, coming from a C/Java/Python background.Controls: Use up and down to switch lines. 1-5 are line hotkeys. Type the words before they make it to the left side of the screen. It's like Typing of the Dead, but with bad words.Link: [Politically Correct: The Game](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/games/politicallycorrect/redacted.html)Status: Games 2/6
