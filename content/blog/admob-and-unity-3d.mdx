It's surprisingly difficult to incorporate AdMob advertising into Unity3D games. There are commercial plugins available, but I would have thought it's a simple matter to connect to an AdMob server, pull down an image, and throw it on the screen with a hyperlink and forwarder ID. That said, incredible progress has been made on the full version of MethRacer. It's working on a Droid 3 and Droid 1 beautifully.
