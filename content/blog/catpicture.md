`$ cat picture.png | catpicture`This is a stupid simple utility that I'm now really glad to have. I call it "catpicture" and it's a tool to cat pictures to the command line. I spend a lot of time SSH-ed into remote machines doing ML or image processing, and I hate having to pull down a picture just to see if it's garbage. This tool will take (either via stdin or the args) an image and dump a rescaled version to the terminal using ANSI colors.You can view the source at <https://github.com/josephcatrambone/catpicture>.You can download a version of the utility for Linux here: [http://josephcatrambone.com/projects/catpicture/catpicture_linux](projects/catpicture/catpicture_linux)[![catpicture_screenshot1](./img/wp-content-uploads-2016-06-Screen-Shot-2016-06-11-at-6.42.54-PM-150x150.png)](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-11-at-6.42.54-PM.png) [![catpicture_screenshot2](./img/wp-content-uploads-2016-06-Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-9.53.44-PM-150x150.png)](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-9.53.44-PM.png)
