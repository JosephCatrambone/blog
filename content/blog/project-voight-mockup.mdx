With the language model happily training away, it's time to get started drawing the front-end. I know that I really want something reminiscent of Lucasart Graphic Adventures. I've yet to figure out what portion of users will be running windowed and what an ideal resolution to target is. I'll have to finalize that before starting on the art, but I can still mock up the UI in a way that's resizable.[![Interview Mockup 4x Upscale](http://www.josephcatrambone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/interview_mockup_upscaled.png)](./img/wp-content-uploads-2015-03-interview_mockup_upscaled.png)
