I'd like to encourage everyone to take a moment to sign this petition on blocking the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/veto-national-defense-authorization-act-2012-several-provisions-bill-pose-threat-civil-liberties/GLfhBn6D "National Defense Authorization Act").  The act itself is not malicious, but there are pieces which are horribly insidious.  The largest discontent stems from the clause which authorizes the indefinite detention of US citizens without trial or right to legal representation.  This is a subtle landmine of a footnote on a budget bill.  It's also the best use of WeThePeople I've seen recently -- it invokes powers directly available to the president and does so in an immediate and observable way.
